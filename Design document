program flow:
Choose file?
-
Check file type?
-
Read file
-
Separate each entry
-
Separade the values in each entry
-
Create an object(entry) and set the fields of the object to the values
	During the creation of an object the values are tested
		If there is at least one entry that is incorrect then the object will be marked as faulty
		The specific fault will be recorded in the object
-
Create a list with all the entries(that are objects now)
-
Creat a list with only valid entries
-

When an entry fails a check then it gets a fault object added to its faults. 
A entry can have several faults which can be accessed by the user.
One of the faults can be that 2 entries are on the same line in the input file
One of the faults can be that the finishTime is before the startTime

If the ID/name is wrong the program can search for an entry with the same name/ID and correct the faulty value.


Some faults can be fixed by the program?

If there is a correct start time and finish time input the program can check  if the time between these 2 are 
reasonable and give an error if cheating(misinput) is suspected? 
The minimun time required for a timespan to be valid can be configured by the user?

Expand on RaceTypeChecker? Where it can give suggestions if the value is close

Implement a method to clear faults when the associated value has been corrected?

Choose path of file?

Return a Fault instead of a list when only one fault should be returned?

Make  UI?
